# Graph_Algorithms
Framework for constructing graphs and computing graph algorithms(shortest path, etc)

Currently have working graph construction and fully implemented Djikstra's, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall, and Transitive Closure algorithms as shown in Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition by Leiserson, Stein, Rivest, and Cormen. Also have functional version of Topological Sort given by Kahn's Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm); plan to extend support for returning set of all orderings in the future.

future goals: implementation of other graph algorithms described in the book, GUI/Graphical representation for graphs, animation of algorithm steps
