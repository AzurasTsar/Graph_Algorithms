# Graph_Algorithms
Framework for constructing graphs and computing graph algorithms(shortest path, etc)

Currently have working graph construction and fully implemented Djikstra's algorithm for single-source shortest path as shown in Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition by Leiserson, Stein, Rivest, and Cormen.

future goals: GUI/Graphical representation for graphs, animation of algorithm steps, implementation of other graph algorithms described in the book (Bellman Ford, Floyd-Warshall, etc)
